Timestamp,I feel like the work I did contributed to the project's overall goals,"If I didn't have the answer, someone on the team partnered with me to find it",Within this sprint I was able to work towards my own long term goals,I am able to vocalize when I feel like I might not meet deadlines without fear or punishment/judgement ,Project work did not hurt my ability to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle,I can sign off and not worry about the things I didn't get done today,"I can honestly share my opinions (whether in retro, refinement, etc.) with respecful conversation instead of conflict",I can provide honest internal feedback with regards to client situations and processes,Leadership respects technical and process choices I make even if something fails
